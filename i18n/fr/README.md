# References for French translation

Based on the printed French version of the game, here is some note to ensure consistent translating.

## Character replacement table

| Character to Avoid | Replace By | Example|
| - | - | - |
| ``'`` | ``’`` | ``L'Être`` -> ``L’Être``|
| ``oe`` | ``œ`` | ``oeil`` -> ``œil`` |

## Ponctuation

Make sure you respect the spacing before and after column, question marks, etc.

## Earthborne Rangers specifics

##### Harm and Progress

Don't put space between ``[harm]`` or ``[progress]`` markers and numbers (including X's).
Good: ``1[harm]`` / ``X[progress]``
Bad: ``1 [harm]`` / ``X [progress]``

##### Card Layout adjustment

To fit on the physical cards some of the rules above were bented to make the layout clean. Since, the current database isn't used to make cards, we disregard the printing aspect when we translate the text.

## What to do if you find a typo or an error on a card?

You can submit French typos or errors to **Intrafin** by using their [web contact form](http://www.intrafin.eu/fr/contact-us).
